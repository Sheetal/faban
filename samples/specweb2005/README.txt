                    SPECweb2005 README

The SPECweb2005 sample gives an idea how to integrate with an existing
benchmark by implementing the Benchmark interface directly. This is relevant
in case the benchmark was not written for the Faban driver framework. For
the SPECweb2005 sample to work, you'll need to obtain the SPECweb2005 kit
from SPEC, install it according to SPEC's documentation and point the benchmark
to the SPECweb client installation. This is done through the submission form.
The Faban harness is only acting as the benchmark process controller here.
