                    Faban Harness Workload README

This is a more complete benchmark than web1. It is used to test the Faban
harness. It re-uses the generic components from Web1. The driver drives
real operations to Faban and analyzes the response for subsequent
operations. It is a good starting point for an elaborate web benchmark.
